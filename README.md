# Innovative-Academic-Planning-Companion
1. Initialize:
   - Define courses, their prerequisites, and associated academic loads.
   - Set maximum and minimum academic load, maximum and minimum courses per period.
   - Set the maximum number of academic periods.
   - Initialize an empty schedule.

2. Assign Initial Schedule:
   - Assign courses to periods, either randomly or using an initial criterion.

3. Iterative Refinement:
   - Repeat for a defined number of iterations or until convergence:
     a. Calculate academic load and course count for each period.
     b. Identify over- and under-loaded periods.

     c. Load Balancing:
        i. For each over-loaded period, try to move courses to the next period(s) with lighter loads.
       ii. Prioritize moving courses with fewer prerequisites first.

     d. Prerequisite Handling:
        i. Check if basics for a course are assigned to earlier periods.
       ii. If not, adjust the schedule to accommodate prerequisites.


     e. Calculate Metrics:
        i. Recalculate academic load and course count for each period.

4. Optimization (optional):
   - Consider using optimization techniques like integer programming or genetic algorithms to find a better solution.

5. Review and Validation:
   - Check if the generated schedule meets all constraints and regulations.

6. Fine-tuning and Feedback:
   - Based on feedback, make further adjustments as needed.

7. Output:
   - Once a balanced schedule is achieved, output the final schedule.
